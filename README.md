# Cipher

Cipher is a simple cipher tool created in Python. The tool can encrypt or decrypt a message, by rotating every character *x*
amount of times. This encryption method is very basic and should only be used for experimentating, as it can easily be reverse
engineered by a computer. The encryption method is based on the ROT13 protocol.
